### Hello World
Welcome to our public Github page, which follows the development of the <a href="http://www.dbolical.com">DBolical Web Engine</a> which runs on a LNMPJ stack (Linux, NGNIX, mySQL, PHP, jQuery) and is coded according to the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. This engine powers <a href="http://www.moddb.com">ModDB.com</a>, <a href="http://www.indiedb.com">IndieDB.com</a>, <a href="http://www.slidedb.com">SlideDB.com</a> and a number of other sites, providing a CMS (content management system) which organizes content into profiles (i.e. games, groups, members, mods etc). These profiles are then filled with content from sources such as articles, downloads, videos, images etc. This allows new profiles to be deployed and new/old content to be linked quickly and easily. Each module (a module been a profile or a generic source, i.e. games or articles) implements a number of standard methods, allowing content to be added, edited and browsed in the format required (HTML, XML, RSS etc).

### Design Philosophy
At DBolical we believe in agile and minimalistic design practices. Excess functionality is bloat which interferes, slows down and confuses the users experience, while also increasing time and development complexity. The minimum number of steps, buttons and words (without sacrificing ease of use) should be used when adding/editing functionality. This philosophy applies to both the sites design and usage. Think Google or Apple for an example of top brands whose designs are built purely with the end users experience in mind.

We also believe in the power of a community and consider the wisdom of many to be better than the intelligence of one. Much like Wikipedia, Youtube, Facebook and other Social sites, since 2002 we have encouraged our communities to contribute content and control the direction of the site by posting news, images, videos, downloads and comments. All functionality is built with our community in mind, so submit a ticket if you have and idea regarding how we can better serve your needs as a member of our community.
